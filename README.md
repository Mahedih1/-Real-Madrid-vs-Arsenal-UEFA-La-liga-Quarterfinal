A Tactical Perspective
Real Madrid‚ÄÇmight bully Arsenal‚Äôs flanks early, taking a 4-2-4 lead. Valverde and Modric will seek midfield superiority, and Mbapp√© and Vin√≠cius‚ÄÇwill look for the occasional counterattack. The‚ÄÇfighting will be literal and high pressing.
Arsenal most often relies on Saka and Martinelli on the break, after soaking up pressure and being compact‚ÄÇdefensively. Rice and parley tucked in front,‚ÄÇset pieces are still an important weapon.

Predictions and Probabilities
On the left‚ÄÇyou can see Real Madrid at 6/1, Arsenal at 1/7 to qualify.
Match Odds: Arsenal 7/2, Real Madrid‚ÄÇ7/10, Draw 3/1.
We know the late-game magic that Real Madrid can produce at the Bernab√©u, so this one is not‚ÄÇover yet, not until the final whistle goes. Which team is theoretically supposed‚ÄÇto go through? Arsenal.
Arsenal can at least take a respectable three-nil aggregate back home when the Bernab√©u will be the‚ÄÇrematch venue. Real Madrid will need an incredible comeback to‚ÄÇreach the last four, as many of its stars have missed out. And now Arsenal, undefeated and unbroken in Europe, is‚ÄÇin contention for a Champions League final, which is a much more exotic destination
