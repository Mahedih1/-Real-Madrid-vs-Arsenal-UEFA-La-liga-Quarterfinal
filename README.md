A Tactical Perspective
Real Madrid might bully Arsenal’s flanks early, taking a 4-2-4 lead. Valverde and Modric will seek midfield superiority, and Mbappé and Vinícius will look for the occasional counterattack. The fighting will be literal and high pressing.
Arsenal most often relies on Saka and Martinelli on the break, after soaking up pressure and being compact defensively. Rice and parley tucked in front, set pieces are still an important weapon.

Predictions and Probabilities
On the left you can see Real Madrid at 6/1, Arsenal at 1/7 to qualify.
Match Odds: Arsenal 7/2, Real Madrid 7/10, Draw 3/1.
We know the late-game magic that Real Madrid can produce at the Bernabéu, so this one is not over yet, not until the final whistle goes. Which team is theoretically supposed to go through? Arsenal.
Arsenal can at least take a respectable three-nil aggregate back home when the Bernabéu will be the rematch venue. Real Madrid will need an incredible comeback to reach the last four, as many of its stars have missed out. And now Arsenal, undefeated and unbroken in Europe, is in contention for a Champions League final, which is a much more exotic destination
